        <p>
            Welcome to Rate My Courses, where we aim to revolutionize how students navigate their academic journeys at Carleton University. Unlike other platforms that focus solely on professors, we bring the entire course experience into the spotlight.
        </p>
        <p>
            We know that a course's difficulty isn't always about the professor. Sometimes it's the course structure, its tough requirements, or the academic guidelines professors must follow. We’re here to make sure students see the full picture because there's always more to a course than just who teaches it.
        </p>
        <p>
            At Rate My Courses, we’re building a space where you can:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Share your honest reviews of courses and help others make better decisions.</li>
            <li>Discover which courses align with your academic strengths and interests.</li>
            <li>Understand the challenges of a course before diving in, beyond just the teaching style.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Our vision is simple: to create a community where students can empower each other with insights, advice, and experiences. We're raising the bar higher than ever because your education deserves more than just ratings it deserves understanding.
        </p>
        <p>
            Join us in transforming how students explore and review courses. Let’s move beyond grading professors to grading experiences. Together, we’re creating something better because learning is more than just a lecture.
